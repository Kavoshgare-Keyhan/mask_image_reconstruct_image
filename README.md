# Reconstruct Masked Images

In this project, we have used 100 classes of ImageNet and loaded a limited number of images from each class. After that, we masked images through two methods, random and gradual. Then, we applied distilbert transformer and vqvae encoder to reconstruct masked images and compare results with the original ones.
